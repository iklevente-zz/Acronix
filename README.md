# Acronix

This web browser is currently under development by Ilyó Kovács Levente for learning purposes. The browser uses [CefSharp](http://https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp/ "CefSharp") to embed the Chromium Framework into the browser and it uses .NET Framework/WinForms UI.

### Currently supports:
- Basic web browsing
- Working url bar

### Plans:
- Make a full featured web browser
- Cookie saving
- Tabs
- A good UI for settings
- Download system
- Fullscreen mode

### Are you a C#/.Net Developer and want to contribute?
Open the Acronix.csproj file. If Visual Studio asks you to save the project (generate the .sln file) please save it as Acronix.sln next to the Acronix-master folder and restore the missing NuGet packages.
