# Acronix

This web browser is currently under development by IlyÃ³ KovÃ¡cs Levente for learning purposes. The browser uses [CefSharp](http://https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp/ "CefSharp") to embed the Chromium Framework into the browser and it uses .NET Framework/WinForms UI.

### Currently supports:
- Basic web browsing (100%)
- Working URL bar (35%)
- Cookie saving (100%)
- Tabs (25%)

### Plans:
- Make a full featured web browser (1%)
- A good UI for settings (0%)
- History saving (0%)
- Save sites to Favourites (0%)
- Download system (0%)
- Fullscreen mode (0%)
