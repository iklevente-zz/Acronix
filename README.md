# Acronix

This web browser is currently under development by Ilyó Kovács Levente for learning purposes. The browser uses [CefSharp](http://https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp/ "CefSharp") to embed the Chromium Framework into the browser and it uses .NET Framework/WinForms UI.

### Currently supports:
- Basic web browsing
- Working URL bar
- Cookie saving

### Plans:
- Make a full featured web browser
- Tabs (25%)
- A good UI for settings
- History saving
- Save sites to Favourites
- Download system
- Fullscreen mode
